# Online-Text-Editor
## About
The name of this project is as simple as it gets.


This is a University Project that I made that aims to be a simple text editor; where you can store your notes online.
The motto for this project is to keep it as simple, and intuitive as possible for the user.

also, no PHP frameworks were used in the making of this Project.

## Features
- Ability to Create, Delete, and View your notes.
- Login feature, so only you can access your notes.
- Simple design, and no clutter.
- No need register an account, just type in your username; and password.

## Things used in this project
- Webix JavaScript library
- JQuery
- AJAX
- MySQL (with PHPMyAdmin)

## Setup
I've included a simple database seeder script under "seeder/seeder.php", run that and the script should automatically create and seed a database for you!
You might want to change the servername, user, and password if your workstation is setup differently from mine. 

## Todo/Planned Features
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Expiry date on idle User accounts
- IP address based account limits

You can find a Live implementation of the Project on my personal website [here](http://kevinfu510.me/Online%20Text%20Editor/)!
